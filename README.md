This platform aims to simplify the process of creating medical prescriptions and placing orders at pharmacies, connecting doctors with their patients. 
In this project, there are three main participants or actors involved:

Doctor: The medical professional responsible for diagnosing patients and prescribing medication.
Patient: The individual seeking medical treatment or advice from the doctor.
Pharmacy: The establishment responsible for dispensing medication prescribed by the doctor to the patient.
